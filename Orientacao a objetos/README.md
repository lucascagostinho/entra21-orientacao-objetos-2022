# Object orientation

> Object-oriented programming is a new way of building technology solutions by abstracting elements from the real world and translating them into the programming context.


> In the real world, we have the habit of classifying everything based on characteristics:

> - People: have name, height, weight, gender and age
> - Animals: species, race, color, sex
> - Chairs: have color, price, material
> - Positions: title, remuneration, obligations
> - Cities: has name, number of inhabitants, mayor, area in kmÂ²
> - And for each of them we perceive common behaviors

> - People: walk, run, talk, age
> - Animals: eat, make noise, move
> - Chairs: can have actions like, fold, regular
> - Positions: has actions such as delegating functions, form of communication, answering the phone, etc.
> - Cities: there are events such as the city's birthday, opening of parks, etc.
> - Everything mentioned above is how the world works
